Create a web app using Blazor and Bootstrap that 
calculates the weather forecast for the next week based
on temperatures from each year from the last 
eight years.

Projects use three APIs for Geolocation:
Geoapify
Ninija API
Geocode

and OpenMeteo for historical Weather Data.

This was my first encounter with making a project in C#.
